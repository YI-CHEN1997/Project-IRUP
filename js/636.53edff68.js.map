The hilly landscape contains farmlands and sloping areas with abundant natural resources. Locals rely on the Han River system and seasonal rainfall for water supply for domestic use and irrigation. Uneven rainfall patterns and high demand for water has led to the overuse of groundwater and conflicts among the people. The surrounding natural forests provide important ecosystem services, including wildlife habitats and water conservation, among others; however, overlap with human activities has brought threats to biodiversity conservation. Considering these challenges, locals were determined to transform their community towards sustainability. The Gonglaoping Industrial Development Association (GIDA) and the Soil and Water Conservation Bureau (SWCB) joined hands to initiate the promotion of the Satoyama Initiative, playing catalytic roles in several implementations, such as establishing water management strategies based on mutual trust, rebuilding the masonry landscape, and economic development, forming partnerships with other stakeholders. This multi-stakeholder and co-management platform allowed the community to achieve transformative changes, particularly in resolving conflicts of water use, restoring the SEPL, enhancing biodiversity conservation, and developing a self-sustaining economy.\n      <br><br>\n      Achieving sustainability in a SEPL requires the application of a holistic approach and a multi-sector collaborating (community-government-university) platform. This case demonstrates a practical, effective framework for government authorities, policymakers and other stakeholders in terms of maintaining the integrity of ecosystems. With the final outcome of promoting a vision of co-prosperity, it is a solid example showing a win-win strategy for both the human population and the farmland ecosystem in a hilly landscape.\n      </h6>\n      <h5 class=\"mb-4\">Study Site</h5>\n      <h6>\n        Gonglaoping, a hillside rural community in Fengyuan District, is situated in the central western part of Taiwan Island (Figure 1), and has approximately 700 residents (Table 1). The main landscape is a terraced terrain with a total area of about 250 ha, containing approximately 100 ha of farmlands and 80 ha of foothills with abundant natural resources. The entire community is located within the upstream watershed of the Han River.\n        <br><br>\n        The mean annual temperature of Gonglaoping is 21.6oC, and weather patterns show distinct seasons with uneven rainfall patterns. The wet season starts in April and lasts until September with a mean monthly precipitation of 268 mm, while the dry season runs from October to March with a mean monthly precipitation of 42 mm.\n      </h6>\n\n      <img src=\"@/assets/irup2-1.png\" alt=\"\">\n      <p>Map of the city, district and case study area. Counter-clockwise from top left, relative location of Taichung City in Taiwan, related location of Fengyuan District, Gonglaoping community, and the Han River upstream watershed.</p>\n\n      <img src=\"@/assets/irup2-table.png\" alt=\"\">\n      <p>Background information of the study area </p>\n\n      <h5 class=\"mb-4\">Challenges</h5>\n      <h6>\n        Due to uneven patterns of precipitation (e.g. the dry season occurring from October to March), the amount of water is insufficient to fulfil local demands; as a result, farmers extract groundwater for irrigation. Alongside climate change impacts, droughts are getting more and more serious as the dry season is lasting longer and leading to over-pumping of groundwater upstream. This situation threatens to jeopardize the water rights of humans and other fauna species living in midstream and downstream areas, and moreover causes water-related conflicts among community people.\n        <br><br>\n        Urban dwellers often have more job opportunities and better salaries. Since the Gonglaoping community is not far from downtown Taichung, young people tend to migrate to the city, causing problems such as an aging labor force and industrial recession. Currently, residents of Gonglaoping aged 60 or above account for 20% of the total population. In other words, the community has fallen into the pitfall of an aging labor force due to youth migrating out. \n      </h6>\n\n      <h5 class=\"mb-4\">Actions and Approaches</h5>\n      <h6>\n        To tackle the challenges mentioned before, the Gonglaoping community committed to seek foster and apply a plan that could lead rural development toward a sustainable future. Locals were also determined to preserve and pass down traditional culture that emphasizes humans living in harmony with nature. Based on that, the Gonglaoping community, National Chung Hsing University (NCHU) and the Soil and Water Conservation Bureau (SWCB), a government agency, joined hands to implement a project based on the Satoyama Initiative (Figure 2), to enable transformative change towards the desired goals of wellbeing and sustainability through several leverage points, which are:\n        <br><br>\n        <ol>\n          <li>Establishing water management strategies and a co-management system (Figure 3).</li>\n          <li>Restoring the masonry production landscape (Figure 4).</li>\n          <li>Enhancing biodiversity conservation.</li>\n          <li>Developing products/services for a sustainable economy (Figure 5).</li>\n          <li>Forming a multi-stakeholder operating platform (Figure 2).</li>\n        </ol>\n        <br>\n        Under such a multi-sectoral, collaborative structure (government-university-community), an array of actions has been carried out to achieve sustainability. These include forest and wildlife-habitat restoration in the upstream catchment area, eco-friendly farming practices to maintain healthy agricultural ecosystems, promotion of smart allocation and mitigation of over-use of water resources, preservation and re-introduction of traditional wisdom (e.g. dry stone masonry), and development of community industry to enhance local incomes. Related activities are described in the following sections.\n      </h6>\n\n      <img src=\"@/assets/Case_Studies_2.png\" alt=\"\">\n      <p>Figure 2: A collaborative, operating platform: roles and responsibility of stakeholders(Source: NCHU) </p>\n\n      <img src=\"@/assets/Case_Studies_3.png\" alt=\"\">\n      <p>Figure 3: The water resources management and recycling system for the Han Riverâ€™s upstream area (Source: NCHU)</p>\n\n      <img src=\"@/assets/irup2-4.5.png\" alt=\"\">\n      <p>Figure 4: Dry masonry construction workshops (Source: NCHU and Gonglaoping community)</p>\n\n      <img src=\"@/assets/irup2-5.6.png\" alt=\"\">\n      <p>Figure 5: Organic agricultural products of the Gonglaoping community (Source: Gonglaoping community)</p>\n\n      <h5 class=\"mb-4\">Conclusions: Key Messages</h5>\n      <h6>\n        Achieving the sustainability of rural development not only requires the application of a holistic approach, but also cross-sector collaboration (community-government-university). The key messages of this case are:\n        <br><br>\n        <ol>\n          <li>The masonry SEPL highlights many valuable functions, including soil and water conservation, a low-impact practice for slope stabilization, maintenance of biodiversity, preservation of traditional wisdom and tourism.</li>\n          <li>Constrained by micro-climatic conditions, the Gonglaoping community is often short of water supply for irrigation in the dry seasons. Locals have learned to facilitate a strategic decision-making routine, with the water allocation plan reviewed and revised weekly so that all orchards can be irrigated for growth. In addition, this mechanism helps avoid conflicts of water use and halts overuse of groundwater in dry seasons. The key element of such effective operation is mutual trust among community residents.</li>\n          <li>Because of the success of organic products, locals are more willing to practice eco-friendly farming, which is a true win-win strategy to sustain water quality, biodiversity and the economy.</li>          \n        </ol>\n        <br>\n        Hence, we are confident that the Gonglaoping community could serve as an example for practical implementation of the Satoyama Initiative on hillside, agricultural landscapes in East Asia.\n      </h6>\n\n    </div>\n\n  </div>\n</main>\n  \n</template>\n\n<style lang=\"scss\" scoped>\n\n.case {\n  padding: 0 10vw 5vh 10vw;\n  text-align: center;\n\n  .date {\n    color: #999;\n    margin-bottom: 1rem;\n  }\n\n  img {\n    width: 70%;\n  }\n\n  .content {\n    margin: 0 6rem;\n\n    h5 {\n      margin: 5rem;\n    }\n\n      h6 {        \n        text-align: justify;\n        margin-right: 3rem;  \n      }\n\n      img {\n        width: 70%;\n        margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0;\n      }\n    }\n  \n  @media (max-width: 850px) {\n    padding: 0 0 1vh 0;\n\n    .content {\n      display: block;\n\n      h3 {\n        margin-bottom: 1rem;\n      }\n\n      h6 {\n        margin-right: 0;\n      }\n\n      img {\n        margin-top: 2rem;\n        width: 60%;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  @media (max-width: 850px) {\n    padding: 0 0 1vh 0;\n\n    .content {\n      h6 {\n        text-align: left;\n\n        li {\n          text-align: left;\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n  \n</style>","import { render } from \"./Case2View.vue?vue&type=template&id=0cdc3612&scoped=true\"\nconst script = {}\n\nimport \"./Case2View.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=0cdc3612&lang=scss&scoped=true\"\n\nimport exportComponent from \"/Users/jane/Desktop/IRUP website/irup-redesign/node_modules/vue-loader/dist/exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render],['__scopeId',\"data-v-0cdc3612\"]])\n\nexport default __exports__"],"names":["_hoisted_1","_createElementBlock","_hoisted_2","script","__exports__","render"],"sourceRoot":""}
